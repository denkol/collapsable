### PANDA react-components

To run move to project folder and type in your terminal:
`npm i; npm run start`


To compile styles you need to use own builder (I use CodeKit app). All that you need to do is compile `stylesheets/main.scss` and place output file into same directory (`stylesheets/main.css`).
